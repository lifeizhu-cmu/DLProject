### Abstract
The autonomous vehicle is a hot topic these days, while vehicle detection, speed detection and lane detection are important aspects of this field of study which may be necessary references for the development of autonomous vehicles. In this project, we plan to do object detection in pictures not only for vehicles but also for other objects showing up in the pictures, such as roadway lanes, bicycles, people, etc. Then we will do speed calculation for vehicles through some continuous videos. By doing this, we can help to provide valuable information to the autonomous driving system. On the basis of reading a lot of literature about object detections and ways to calculate vehicle speed, now we tried two different baseline models, Resnet 50 and Vgg 16 though some experiments using a small dataset of car pictures to find suitable models and evaluation methods according to val accuracy and val average loss. For future work we plan to implement Faster R-CNN on top of the 50-layer and 152-layer variants of residual networks and evaluate it through mean Average Precision, and we expect we would get an improved object detection performance when implementing Faster R-CNN based on residual networks compared to our baseline models.
